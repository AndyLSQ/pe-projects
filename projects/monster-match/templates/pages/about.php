<h1 class="loud-voice1">About MonsterMatch</h1>

<p>MonsterMatch is an online, searchable database of monsters who need homes. It is also a directory of monster shelters and adoption organizations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Organizations maintain their own home pages and available-monster databases.</p>

<h2 class="loud-voice2">Our mission<h2>
<ul>To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:

<li>Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable monsters</li>
<li>Increase the overall effectiveness of monster adoption programs across North America to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable monsters is eliminated</li>
<li>Elevate the status of monsters to that of family member</li>
</ul>

<p>From the comfort of their personal computers, monster lovers can search for a monster that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers.</p>

<p>Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact person should be responsible for direct communications with MonsterMatch. Only nonprofit organizations will be included (but Federal 501(c)(3) status is not necessary).</p>

<p>MonsterMatch is made up of monster-care professionals and regular people volunteering for their local monster welfare organizations all working together to maintain active and accurate homeless monster lists. Most monster welfare volunteers have “real jobs” by day. The success and the magnitude of this project is largely due to their tireless efforts to make a difference.<p>
