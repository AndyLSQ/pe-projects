	<h2>My Favorite Place: Miami</h2>
		<p>I have a lot of favorite places but the first one that comes to mind is Miami, FL. I am a hot weather person. I love beaches, white sand, and blue water. Exotic islands are a great place to go for this, but in the US this is the closest you can get to the tropical. I like California beaches but they're more rocky and the water is colder. I also have a special connection with Miami since I used to go there every year as a kid. It will always be my 'winter break' quick getaway spot.</p>

		<p>I’ve used google docs before, but usually use Microsoft Word so I estimated myself as a 6 in proficiency. I was able to figure out basic features relatively quickly but I'm still more used to the MS layout. This took me 30 minutes.</p>
