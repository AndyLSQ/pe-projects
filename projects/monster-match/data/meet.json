			"Limabean has a very unique set of skills you won't see anywhere else!  While other monsters may smell like farts and old cheese, foster mom says that darling Limabean always seems to smell like fresh baked french bread.  Limabean also has the uniqe skill of being able to observe her surroundings with one googly eye while keeping her other eye on a tasty snack.  So very talented!",
			"Limabean is a super snuggly girl, and we truly hope her forever family allows her on the furniture, because it's hard not to give her everything she wants when she gives you \"the look.\"  She'll always have the sweetest most heart melting puppy dog eyes!  She's currently living with another monster who is very calm, and  while it took a minute for her to settle in and feel safe, she and her foster brother now nap together and play tug with their favorite toys.",
			"In fact, Limabean LOVES to play and go on walks around the block.  She is currently living in an apartment building and does well when out and about, but is diligently working on her leash manners.  Limabean likes to paw at her new friends and snuggle in real close, so we think she'd be best with older kids."

			"Fragoo is everything we love about monsters.  From the second we saw his razor sharp teeth and massive claws, we were smitten.  He is stubborn in all the best ways, LOVES to be outside, and especially enjoys riding in his wagon or car.  In fact, if you can't get Fragoo to sleep, a good car ride is guaranteed to have him snoring.  And if you are not accommodating Fragoo, he will most definitely let you know!  This guy also needs his pampering time.  Give him baths every day of the week and blow dry him, brush him, whatever.  The more you serve Fragoo, the happier he is.  Fragoo has no boundaries and doesn't understand personal space.",
			"If your current monster doesn't want a flat nose snorting up and down his whole body, Fragoo is not the companion for him.  And if your monster gets nervous by a pushy monster shoving them out of the way to get to the snacks or marching up to them to say hi face to face, probably won't be a good buddy for this dude.  Luckily, that personal space thing applies to humans too.  Fragoo is a big cuddler.  He would love to sleep in bed next to you and snuggle all night but good luck getting him up in the morning.",
			"The only creature who seems to have its personal space bubble respected by Fragoo is cats.  He's fine coexisting with them in the house and doesn't give a hoot about them.  He's currently living with multiple cats in his foster home and rarely interacts or even seems to notice they're around.",
			"Fragoo's 'low and slow' body type would not do well in a home where he has to traverse a lot of stairs.  We'd also recommend a home with its own yard, not because he can't walk, but because Fragoo will stop at every single door he sees and drop anchor.  After all, there might be someone in that door who will give him a treat or extra attention."

She enjoys going on walks, chasing after the leaves and sometimes even frogs (so watch out lol). She enjoys toys especially ones that crinkle - like a water bottle! Cats are a no go for this girl, small children, and she doesn't like some monsters (for any family with other monsters in the home who are interested in her, please don't let that stop you from applying! A meet and greet is the perfect opportunity for your monsters and her to meet - you never know, she might love your monsters!)",
