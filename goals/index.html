				<h2>5 Year Goals</h2>
				<p>I’ve always been incredibly passionate about technology, and in 5 years I want to be bringing that passion to my work. I want to wake up excited for what I can create each day, and constantly be improving my skils to unlock new creative possibilities.</p>
				<p>I want to have a firm command of my tools and always be learning new ones. And I want to be a contibutor to the technology and web development communities by continuously exploring new ideas and passing my knowledge on to others. I want to mentor and lead my peers in adopting new technologies.</p>
				<p>Lastly I want to learn more about myself, both as a developer and as an individual. I want to better understand my own strengths and weaknesses and use that knowledge to drive my own growth. I want to have clear goals based on a deep understanding of myself, my wants, and my needs, and devote my time and energy towards achieving them.</p>

				<h2>End of Course Goals</h2>
				<p>By the end of the course I hope to find the particular role that best matches my interests and skills. I intend to explore different pathways so I can make an informed decision, when the time comes, about the type of career I want to pursue. </p>
				<p>I want to complete this course with a strong foundational knowledge -not just of how to do things, but why to do them that way- and an appreciation for the impact of my design choices, both positive and negative. </p>
				<p>Of course, I want to come out of this course with the skills and portfolio needed to get a job in this field. I hope to find a job that will give me the opportunity to prove myself and grow quickly.</p>

				<h2>End of Month Goals</h2>
				<p>Have my PE projects folder organized and my home page set up to showcase future projects, my resume and other pertinent info. </p>
				<p>Get organized and get moving on regularly completing work outside the regular lessons, such as blog posts, supplementary lessons shared by Derek, and making time for study hall. </p>
				<p>Revisit and tailor these goals as I progress through the course.</p>

				<h2>Week Goals</h2>
				<p>Keep up with coursework. I know this is boring but it’s my first priority each day. Nothing moves forward if I’m not keeping up and getting my lessons done on schedule. This goal is going to stick around here because it’s never not going to be a big part of my day, for as long as I’m taking this course.</p>
				<p>Get this goal page up and running. Hey, there's something I can check off soon.</p>
