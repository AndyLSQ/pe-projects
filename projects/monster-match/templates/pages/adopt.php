How can I find a monster that’s the best fit for my family?</p>

<p>
As you begin your search for a new family member, there are a few important things to keep in mind. Most importantly, you need to think through what will be a good fit for both your family and the monster. Thinking through the lifestyle and needs of both your family and your future monster will help ensure you find the right companion.
</p>

<p>
Here are some important considerations to help you and your family identity some of the qualities you would like in a new companion animal:</p>

<p>
Activity Level – It’s important to consider the energy level of your future monster to ensure it matches that of your family.

Household Type – The amount of space in your home is an important factor in determining the right adoptable monster for you — a large home or a studio apartment affects the type of monster that makes sense for your current situation. 

<p></p>
Additional considerations are things like yard space — are you living in the suburbs or the city, do you have access to outside space, etc.

Family Dynamic – If you live in a hectic, loud home with kids running around, that should be considered. Or, if you have other monsters, you will want to ensure your new companion will get along with everyone already living in your home.

How much time do you have to spend with a monster – We also encourage you think about whether you’d like a monster that both gives and needs a lot of attention, or would you prefer a monster that is more independent?

Training – Many adoptable monsters are already trained, but you should certainly consider the amount of training you want to do to determine both the type and age of your new companion monster.

There are many more possible considerations — gender, allergies, etc. — so the best way to help ensure your family makes the best decision is to consult an adoption counselor at your local shelter or rescue. They will be able to help you narrow in on selecting a monster that will match your lifestyle, while also ensuring your lifestyle matches the needs of the monster.

Good luck in your search!
