This is an attempt to show how to build a mini PHP frameworm. A true "**P**ersonal **H**ome **P**age"

This is forked off of the responsive-garden project to start

## What will this involve?

* [x] Fork a project that is mostly setup in the right direction + start readme
* [x] Get a git repo hooked up
* [x] Get standard page routing set up / at least three pages
* [x] Get the pages backed by data
* [x] Get detail routes setup
* [x] Get the project detail pages backed by data (these are the case-studies / eventually)
* [x] Get a style guide setup with one of each module
* [x] Add style-guide specific modules
* [x] Get a detail route for each module
* [ ] Work out prefers color scheme CSS
* [ ] Work out PHP cookie for color scheme override
* [ ] User login with a secret area of some sort
* [ ] Flesh out case studies with data-based modules
* [ ] Work out some sort of CRUD somewhere (with JSON)
* [ ] ...

And whatever else I can think of along the way...

## Future ideas

* [ ] change `?page=contact` to `/contact` etc.
* [ ] ...
