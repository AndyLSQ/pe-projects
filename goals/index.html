				<h2>5 Years (2027)</h2>

				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Passion in work</h3>
					<p>I’ve always been incredibly passionate about technology, and in 5 years I want to be bringing that passion to my work. I want to wake up excited for what I can create each day, and constantly be improving my skils to unlock new creative possibilities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Continuous learning</h3>
					<p>I want to have a firm command of my tools and always be learning new ones. And I want to be a contibutor to the technology and web development communities by continuously exploring new ideas and passing my knowledge on to others. I want to mentor and lead my peers in adopting new technologies.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Know myself</h3>
					<p>Lastly I want to learn more about myself, both as a developer and as an individual. I want to better understand my own strengths and weaknesses and use that knowledge to drive my own growth. I want to have clear goals based on a deep understanding of myself, my wants, and my needs, and devote my time and energy towards achieving them.</p>

				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Find my path</h3>
					<p>By the end of the course I hope to find the particular role that best matches my interests and skills. I intend to explore different pathways so I can make an informed decision, when the time comes, about the type of career I want to pursue. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Rock solid foundation</h3>
					<p>I want to complete this course with a strong foundational knowledge -not just of how to do things, but why to do them that way- and an appreciation for the impact of my design choices, both positive and negative. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="goal">
					<h3>Employment & growth potential</h3>
					<p>Of course, I want to come out of this course with the skills and portfolio needed to get a job in this field. I hope to find a job that will give me the opportunity to prove myself and grow quickly.</p>
