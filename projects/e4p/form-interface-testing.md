# UX Testing

## Burooj
### Index page:
* Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?
    * Yes
* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
    * Yes its pretty clear. You could always add a brief description on the index page for first-time visitors.

### Forms:
* How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
    - Pretty clear what the forms are doing. You could add brief descriptions to each form if you wanted but the forms are simple anyways.
* Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
    * The inputs an buttons are legible and have labels but theres some text overlap with the label and the user input after you enter data and click somewhere else on the page.
* Does the form work? Can you break it?
    * Yes, the form works. Don’t think i can break it. 
* Do things jump around when you interact with them?
    * It jumps around a little bit because the fields and buttons resize when you interact with them.
* Is the outcome clear?
    * Yes. Only suggestion would be showing an error message when a required field isnt input by the user.
* Do the form styles match across all forms?
    * Yes
* Is it a pleasure to use?
    * Yes. Love the color scheme and I like that you added a button to each form to take you back to the index.

 	* Some of the fields are prepopulated with a string that says “Enter here” and you have to delete it to type your own input. I would change that from a value to a placeholder.
